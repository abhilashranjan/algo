Find maximum length sub-array having given sum - Techie Delight



Given an array of integers, find maximum length sub-array having given sum.

For example, consider below array


 A[] = { 5, 6, -5, 5, 3, 5, 3, -2, 0 }
  Sum = 8

   Sub-arrays with sum 8 are

  { -5, 5, 3, 5 }
  { 3, 5 }
  { 5, 3 }

  The longest subarray is { -5, 5, 3, 5 } having length 4

Naive solution would be to consider all sub-arrays and find their sum. If sub-array sum is equal to given sum, we update maximum length sub-array. The time complexity of naive solution is O(n3) as there are n2 sub-arrays and it takes O(n) time to find sum of its elements. The method can be optimized to run in O(n2) time by calculating sub-array sum in constant time.
